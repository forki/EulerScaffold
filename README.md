# EulerScaffold

This project can be used to scaffold a .NET solution which can be used as a base for solving [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems. 
It was inspired by (and is based on) [ProjectScaffold](https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold/) project. 

## Features
* stripped down modification of [ProjectScaffold](https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold/)
* based on script files and intended for solving problems in an interactive manner
* template based creation of script files
* [MathNet.Numerics.FSharp](http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/) included by default
